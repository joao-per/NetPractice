## 📌 Overview

Embark on a journey 🚀 through the intricacies of networking with the NetPractice Levels. These challenges are meticulously crafted to deepen your understanding of core networking concepts, such as TCP/IP addressing, ports, IPs, subnet masks, and much more.

## 🌟 Features & Concepts Covered

- TCP/IP Addressing: 🌍 Decode the art of transferring data in a network, ensuring seamless communication between devices.

- IP Addresses: 🖥️ Dive deep into the unique identifiers that every device on a network needs to communicate.

- Ports: 🚪 Explore the virtual endpoints for sending and receiving data. From well-known ports to dynamic ones, learn how they drive communication.

- Subnet Masks: 🎭 Unravel the mystery of subnetting. Segment networks efficiently and understand how devices interact within and outside their subnets.

- Network Topologies: 🕸️ Discover how different devices are interconnected, shaping the flow of data and communication.

- Routing & Routers: 🌉 Navigate the paths data packets take, and get to know the guardians (routers) that ensure they reach their correct destination.

- Real-world Application: 🛠️ With each level, apply theoretical concepts to practical scenarios, ensuring you're industry-ready!


### 📌 TCP: The Transport Guardian

TCP, or Transmission Control Protocol, acts as the communication beacon ensuring smooth data transfer over networks. By establishing steadfast connections, TCP chops vast data amounts into digestible packets and ensures their seamless and lossless delivery from source to destination.

### 🌐 IP Address: The Digital Identity

Comprising the grand internet protocol suite alongside TCP, the IP (Internet Protocol) governs the norms for data packetizing, transmission, addressing, and reception over networks. Each device plugged into the web demands a unique IP address – a digital identity. This address blends two components: one spotlighting the host device and the other, its residing network. And to distinctly separate them? Enter the Subnet Mask!

### IPv4 vs. IPv6: The Generations of IP

While IPv4 paints the IP address using 32-bits, the burgeoning internet growth spurred the creation of IPv6, wielding a hefty 128-bits for the IP address. However, NetPractice leans solely on IPv4.
Public vs. Private Address: The Networking Dichotomy

Public IPs are the global identifiers, directly accessible via the internet and bestowed upon your network by the ISP. This address bridges the inside of your network to the digital outside. In contrast, private IPs are the unique, internal labels assigned by your network router. Remember, certain ranges are earmarked solely for private IPs, ensuring clarity and order in the vast sea of network addresses.

### 🎭 Subnet Mask: The Separator

This 32-bit tool dissects the IP address, distinguishing between its network and host portions. By translating the mask into its binary form and applying it to the IP, the network address emerges. Moreover, to discern usable host addresses, the remaining bits of the mask guide the way.

### CIDR Notation: The Compact Mask

Subnet masks take a more concise form with CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing). Using a slash followed by bit numbers, it denotes which bits constitute the network address.

### 🔁 Switch: The Local Connector

A switch plays matchmaker, binding multiple devices in one network. Its focus remains purely local, devoid of external interfaces, keeping the conversation internal.

### 🌉 Router: The Network Bridge

While switches unite devices, routers interlink multiple networks. Furnished with an interface for every connected network, routers ensure that their IP address ranges never clash, maintaining network individuality.
Routing Table: The Navigator's Chart

Inside a router lies its compass - the routing table. It lists down pathways to specific network destinations. In the NetPractice universe, the routing table revolves around two pillars:

- Destination: It earmarks the network address where packets should head. If no specific route fits an IP's destination, the default route steps in, steering packets without a clear destination.

- Next hop: Acting as the guiding star, it points to the immediate next router in a packet's journey, storing this crucial information in every router's table.
